Thank you, dear. It's comforting to know there are still kind souls like you around
I noticed you are in a bit of rush, let me tell you something, young soul
Life's not a sprint, you know; it's a stroll through meadows and mountains alike
Time slips away faster when you're racing against it
The secret is to let it flow like a gentle stream
