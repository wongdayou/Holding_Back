{shuffle stopping:
    - Oh dear, I really can't wait any longer. This queue is taking forever
    - My bladder's about to stage a rebellion here
    - I feel like I'm going to burst
    - I shouldn't have had that giant potion before leaving the house
    - Desperate times call for desperate measures
    - Oh my stars, why does it always seem like I have the world's most urgent bladder when there's a line for the restroom?
    -Oh, sweet relief is getting closer. I can almost taste it.
